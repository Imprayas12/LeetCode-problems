â€‹ Make frequency arrays for top row and bottom row.
Record frequency of each value on dice in both arrays. If row[i] == bottom [i] , take a third array and record the same values' frequency in that array. In the end if we find an element whose frequency in frq1 + frq2 - same adds up to give top row's length then we have our answer. 

TC - O(n)

SC - O(1)
